# PwnDroid: Introduction to Source Code Review & Dynamic Analysis
**Repository**: https://github.com/QiaoNPC/CSLU_PwnDroid_Workshop

A practical workshop on analyzing Android applications through source code review and dynamic analysis using powerful tools and hooking techniques.

In this workshop, you'll learn:

- ✅ How to use `jadx-gui` for static analysis  
- ✅ How to hook Android functions and change their behavior  
- ✅ How to work with non-`MainActivity` components  
- ✅ How to bypass checks and extract flags dynamically  

---
